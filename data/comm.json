Good team communication skills make goals more reachable, increase efficiency, provide better solutions, create positive relationships and a culture of celebration, and reduce or diffuse conflict. These communication skills foster trust between teammates, and this creates an environment for positive professional relationships to take root and grow. When teammates know each other well, they become acquainted with each others' strengths, weaknesses, tendencies and thought processes, which makes it easier to work together toward a common goal and plan for future projects. Positive work relationships add a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction to the job, which can aid in employee retention and a stable work environment. Good team communication skills are not simply about assigning tasks or troubleshooting problems. Whenever a group of people work toward a common goal, conflict is likely to arise at one time or another. Whether conflict is due to unfair expectations, irresponsibility or plain misunderstanding, good team communication skills let everyone have a voice and feel heard. When it is safe to express thoughts clearly, honestly and tactfully, it is easier to move forward with a solution that has everyone's best interest at heart.

Good communication enables to identify and resolve conflicts early and to improve employee engagement. Telling people how they should talk to each other can sound like you're micromanaging your team. But creating guidelines around communication skills in a team can help to prevent misunderstandings and make adopting a new tool a more seamless process. For example, specifying how often you expect team members to check into their team app can prevent them from worrying that they will miss an important update. One of the simplest reasons why cross-team communication fails is that people miss meetings. They prioritize their own team's tasks over the tasks that make up a cross-team project. They just don't show up. That's usually because cross-functional teams don't have a clear accountability leader or hierarchy that oversees all aspects of a team collaboration project. Assigning someone the responsibility to check that all members of a cross-functional team are actively involved can keep projects from getting delayed.
