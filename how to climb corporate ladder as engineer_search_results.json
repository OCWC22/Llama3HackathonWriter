This is my second job out of school and I&#39;m enjoying it quite a lot so far. But I often see/interact with directors/VPs that appear to be in their late 30s to early 40s. I can only imagine what they make...\n  </p><p>\n    I know it&#39;s generalization and speculation but how did they get to their positions so early on? Kissing maximum ass? Being really good engineers and making the company a ton of money? Getting lucky? Devoting every waking moment to the company and sacrificing a personal life? Have daddy put in a good word? Go golfing with upper management regularly?\n  </p><p>\n    And whatever they did, was it worth it to get to that position? Being the decision maker, making all that money, being in meetings 95% of the day, being expected to answer calls/emails on vacation and at 2AM?\n  </p><p>\n    Should I even bother trying to guide my career towards that path or just keep doing my job to the best of my ability while maintaining a thriving personal life? Should I bounce from job to job often? IF I wanted to be at that level, what is the quickest way to get there?\n  </p>",
                    "answer": {
                        "text": "<div>\n<p>\n    I've been at this awhile and played the game.  I was a young engineer and made front line manager before I was 30.  Here's a few of the things that I learned the hard way.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    You must always advocate for yourself.  No one else will do it for you.  Now there's a million ways to do it, and company culture will dictate a lot of it, but never assume someone else has your best interests in mind.  Part of this is learning to play politics.  To many people in my career were proud to profess \"I don't play politics\" only to be sidelined.  Games get played with or without your consent, don't be passive.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    You're an engineer, you bring a skill set that others don't.  I was always ruthless and meticulous at bringing the facts to light.  I earned the reputation of having all my facts in order once by screwing over a director from another department when he tried to screw me over in a meeting.  After that hard earned reputation was won, I did everything I could to maintain it.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    You will never have enough time, or ability to do everything.  Become a master at dropping bullshit and picking what's important over what's pressing.  People will love to misdirect you and waste your time, so get just as good at saying no as saying yes.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Finally, in today's day an age the ability to grow in a single company is mostly a dead idea.  Balance your career and set goals.  If you aren't making those goals at one company?  Move.  You should be prepared to move to other parts of the country too.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Finally, read, read, read.  You should be reading lots of books on everything from sales, negotiation, to workflow ideas.  Always sharpen the saw.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    You can have a balanced personal life and work life.  There will be some points where you need to put one over the other, but in the end if you build your life right, you'll make that choice, not others.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Edit to add:  A couple of people have asked the same or similar questions.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Books?  There's so many I've read, but a few to start are:\n  </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n    <p>\n    7 habits of highly successful people\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    Never Split the Difference\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    48 laws of power\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    The 4 hour work week\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    How to win friends and influence people\n  </p>\n  </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n    In general with books, don't be afraid to read anything.  I've had epiphanies reading about late 1920's monetary policy.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    A couple of people have asked about office politics.  Here's the key take away.  You can be Machiavelli, or you can be Cincinnatus.  The most important thing to understand?  How the game is played.  Even if you want to chill, be a good worker, and keep your head below the fray you need to understand that the games of power will get played.  I've seen people who picked the wrong mentor, failed to see what was going on and went down with the ship when their mentor crashed and burned.\n  </p>\n</div>\n",

I became an Engineering Director at 45. It is surprising how small the delta $ is for this role. There are people \u201cunder me\u201d who make more than I do, as they should.",

Gradually increase your responsibility and show you can lead projects and teams. Maintain a high say:do ratio. Also learn how to present to audiences at different levels (your presentations and delivery change based on the audience). You need to be able to communicate clearly and effectively.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Visibility = don't shy away from high visibility projects. Remember that being the best engineer in the company doesn't mean anything if your leadership doesn't know about it.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Networking = never underestimate the power of having a strong network. Learn how to market yourself and establish your own brand. Talk about your career goals. Get some mentors both inside and outside your immediate work group to understand the skills you need to develop to get to the job you want. Mentors can also be great advocates for you. Side note: one piece of advice my mentor shared with me is to look at skills and behaviors and not job title. That will help you lay out your career better\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Keep gathering information and lay out a career path with the understanding that:\n  </p>\n<ol>\n      <li>\n    <p>\n    It can always change\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    You have to manage your own career\n  </p>\n  </li>\n    </ol>\n<p>\n    Be careful with \"jumping around\" to keep moving up. You need to make sure your moves are intentional. That is, they have a clear purpose towards your long term goals by helping you close a skill gap or gaining exposure to a key part of the business. Moving between jobs for the band or pay without a clear purpose risks you losing momentum and time towards your end goal.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Edit: Wow! I think this is my first award.

Technical Professionals get calculations thrown over the cubicle for them to process and are generally best left out of the public eye for everyone's mutual enjoyment. They usually have a Technical Masters or even Doctorate and will top out career wise around \"Department Head\" or just \"Technical Professional V: Company Resume Headliner\".

Only a drop-kick with no brain would say this. If you didn\u2019t get a pay rise or promotion a leader will assume you didn\u2019t: ... A career owes you nothing.

I learned quickly that memorizing a few lines of gibberish (aka code) didn\u2019t get you hired. Coding is the language of solving problems. Technical hiring managers care more about how you think about a problem than the code you suggest as your answer. Knowing basic code makes you a better problem-solver.

It seems like there are people who when you put a ladder in front of them, they just want to climb it.",
                    "As an industry, we tend to assume that people want to climb the ladder. Or that people who aren\u2019t interested in it aren\u2019t motivated, or are happy to stagnate and coast. As one of those people, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Some ideas for how to make tech more inclusive by supporting people who aren\u2019t that motivated by the standard career ladder: Create space for people without multi-year plans. I recently talked to an early career engineer who felt overwhelmed because she didn\u2019t have a robust career plan.",
                    "So when I had this exchange on twitter, it felt really reassuring to be in the good company of people I respect, who are by every measure \u201csuccessful\u201d in this industry, on team no-career-goals. But it also got me thinking \u2014 am I really not a goal-oriented person, or am I just motivated by different kinds of goals? When we talk about \u201ccareer goals,\u201d we have something specific in mind, like, \u201cI want to found a startup,\u201d or \u201cI want to be a principal engineer.\u201d I realized that it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have goals, but they\u2019re of a slightly different flavor.",
                    "I left Google because the idea of spending the next 10 years of my life climbing an arbitrary ladder honestly just did not feel very appealing. At that transition, I honestly almost left tech because I wondered, is it really for me, if I\u2019m not interested in climbing the ladder?"

                        "text": "Early on in my career at Morgan Stanley, a senior guy from the US, Arvind Bajaj, or \u2018RV\u2019, moved from New York to join the fast-growing ABS team in London.\n\nHere\u2019s a picture I\u2019ve found of him on the web - he\u2019s the guy on the left. In fact, he recently re-joined Morgan Stanley where his group originates commercial real estate loans.\n\nAnyway, when RV moved to London he happened to get a desk right next to me. I wasn\u2019t reporting to him but over time he became an absolutely fantastic mentor and a good friend.\n\nA few years after moving to London, RV moved to Credit Suisse. A year later, I got a call from a headhunter. Credit Suisse wanted to hire me. Weeks later I had a job offer with a guaranteed bonus offering me the biggest pay rise of my career - a 60% increase - and a big jump in responsibility.\n\nIt was a tough decision because Morgan Stanley was (and still is) one heck of an investment bank - but Credit Suisse's ABS team had ambitious plans and the increased responsibility was a great opportunity. Eventually, I accepted.\n\nRV\u2019s strong recommendation was almost certainly the main driver for me getting an offer. I.e. impressing the guy that sat next to me, that I wasn\u2019t reporting to, landed me a great opportunity and the biggest pay rise of my career.\n\nMy takeaway is this:\n\nTo climb the corporate ladder impress everyone around you and build as many life-long relationships as you can.\n\nFrom those that report to you, to those that you report to, to other colleagues, to clients. Everyone\u2019s watching you, people talk, word gets out, you don\u2019t know who will be doing what later down the road.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how you climb the corporate ladder fast - by impressing EVERYONE around you - by building a reputation.",
