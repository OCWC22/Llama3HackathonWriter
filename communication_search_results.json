For example, specifying how often you expect team members to check into their team app can prevent them from worrying that they will miss an important update.",

They prioritize their own team\u2019s tasks over the tasks that make up a cross-team project. They just don\u2019t show up. That\u2019s usually because cross-functional teams don\u2019t have a clear accountability leader or hierarchy that oversees all aspects of a team collaboration project.

                    "When you encourage employees in different departments to learn about other roles in the company, you\u2019re setting them up for success. The goal isn\u2019t to be able to transfer someone to a different department. Of course, if someone is interested in working in another department, you should have that discussion with them to see if it makes sense. But the goal here is to open the lines of communication and give team members insight into how other departments fit into the organization.",
                    "A good way to offer an anonymous suggestion box to your employees is to use an online form or survey builder software like JotForm, which makes it easy for someone to build a survey in minutes and lets team members submit their responses in anonymity. It can be helpful to include a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Though you may not be able to meet in person to celebrate special occasions, you can still boost morale and encourage communication by celebrating them virtually. Little gestures make a big difference and help to build a community. It helps to make people feel appreciated and valued.",
                    "Make it a point to schedule time weekly to talk with each team member. If the size of your organization makes this difficult, it\u2019s okay to set up the meetings biweekly or monthly instead. These can be audio or video chats, but it helps to use video when possible to bring a real human connection to the conversation. In these one-to-one calls, you can talk to your employee about anything from their workload and thoughts on company policies to their ambitions for moving up in the business.",
                    "But the goal here is to open the lines of communication and give team members insight into how other departments fit into the organization. For example, encourage your marketing department to have regular discussions with your developers. If the marketing team has a better understanding of how the software features are made and work, they can more effectively sell the benefits of it. And vice versa, if the developers know how the product will be marketed, they can communicate how the features work more clearly to the marketing team."
