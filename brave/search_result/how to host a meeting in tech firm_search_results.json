A team-building exercise with dozens of attendees could take the entire meeting if not handled correctly. Remember: this will likely not be the first or last meeting people will have attended."

That\u2019s really what my job is about, creating new and innovative programs to meet people where they are. Let\u2019s talk about the culture of the firm and its commitment to wellness and community. Can you share some recent initiatives with us?",
