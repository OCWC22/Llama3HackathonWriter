There are around 134,100 event planners in the United States, and the job market in that sector is growing at a rapid 7% per year. There is no lack of resources to plan your first tech conference, and you may even be able to find a mentor who will walk you through the technical aspects of putting on an event.",

Start with a checklist of things needing to be completed as you move toward the big day. You may have planned for this for years and already have some ideas, but there are some very specific things you must do as you go along. A year before the conference may seem like a long time for planning, but you can never start too early when it comes to putting things together for a large group of people."
