If you're discussing development roadmaps with a team with varying levels of technical knowledge, consider the language used and whether you might want to circulate FAQs or explainers ahead of the meeting. When including facilitation methods, exercises or games, bear in mind the number of attendees and whether you might need breakout groups. A team-building exercise with dozens of attendees could take the entire meeting if not handled correctly. Remember: this will likely not be the first or last meeting people will have attended.",

Anything that can't be discussed within the time limit you give it, wasn't properly thought through before the meeting and should be researched more. It's clear who's running the meeting. A meeting without an owner is what we refer to as 'clusterfuck'. This person doesn't need to be a professional moderator, scrum master or whatever but at least they should ensure that people are not talking about Tim's new scooter for 15 minutes. Start with a prototype. If a meeting revolves around creating a documentation of your hiring process (for example), get someone to write a draft version first. Do not make 10 people stare at a blank sheet of Google Docs paper. It's so much easier to collaborate on something that has been already started than to start from scratch, especially as a committee.",

Many moving parts must all come together in a perfect dance of elements at just the right time. There is no reason for you to compete with giants such as Google or IBM to gain attendees, however. A small conference with a niche focus will attract just the people you want. Push meetings to every other week for the next two months. How did you get here? You only have one month left before your seminar. There's a lot to do, so now is the time to delegate all those little tasks. Finalize the schedule and create a printout for attendees. Appoint workers to handle registration and directing people from one event to the next. Event planning is a big business. There are around 134,100 event planners in the United States, and the job market in that sector is growing at a rapid 7% per year. There is no lack of resources to plan your first tech conference, and you may even be able to find a mentor who will walk you through the technical aspects of putting on an event. Start with a checklist of things needing to be completed as you move toward the big day. You may have planned for this for years and already have some ideas, but there are some very specific things you must do as you go along. A year before the conference may seem like a long time for planning, but you can never start too early when it comes to putting things together for a large group of people.",

To do this, you can first start by asking your team before the meeting if they have anything to share. Then, in the meeting agenda, you can make time slots for these individuals. Also, at the very end of the meeting, you can go around in a circle and give everyone a chance to say any thoughts. People might hold back negative feelings about the company and its culture, priorities, or strategy. If they don't voice their opinions, nothing will change, so you need to nudge them to speak their minds. Of course, these questions only produce aboveboard and useful answers if you've created an environment in which team members feel safe about sharing their thoughts. As you move through the meeting, provide real-time updates on where you are in your agenda. Devil's advocate: In charge of challenging the team's assumptions or ideas. Even if they agree with a decision, they still ask questions that provoke thought among the group about its validity. Think of this role as quality testing the components of the meeting. (It's also the most fun.) When your team members have a responsibility during the meeting, they're more involved. Like investors in a startup, they have a stake in its success.",

The goal of the engineering team meeting is to discuss what each team has been working on to get everyone up to speed on what's happening in the engineering department. Things like work-in-progress demos and technical difficulties that team members are facing will be discussed. Team meetings are one of the most important meetings a company can have. These meetings are usually (or always in the case of remote environments) the only time that team members can meet as a group and discuss. So, allow the meeting experts to share their best tips for how to run a successful meeting that will leave your engineers feeling empowered and ready to work. Adding a \"Discussion Topics\" point to your agenda will ensure that there is time allotted for things such as updates from the managers, feedback about new processes, new ideas or thoughts, and questions from team members.

While all meeting roles are important, a meeting cannot happen without a leader. This person ensures the meeting is successful from the planning phase to the follow-up. Far too often, meetings are dominated by just one or two people. The facilitator should ensure that everyone in attendance has an opportunity to speak. Be observative: The meeting facilitator must pay close attention throughout the meeting to ensure everyone stays on topic, all attendees have an opportunity to speak, and the meeting goal gets accomplished.

          "suggestions": "In January, my friend Bennett Phillips and I hosted our first conference together, called The Talent Development Think Tank. By all measures and accounts it was a big success. So we went out and got two big name speakers in our niche - Josh Bersin and Liz Wisman who are both huge in the HR talent development space. And I think, not everybody came for them, but it definitely legitimized the conference and made people think this is the real deal. It makes a big difference. This depends on the type of event so if you have a lower priced ticket maybe you don't provide much. But we had a pretty expensive ticket, $1,500 on average so I think people were expecting food. It ended up being way more expensive than we expected but the food was phenomenal and everyone appreciated it. Early on I hired my friend Lauren Davis to run social media for our event and it paid off big time. We also pushed everyone to use our handles and hashtags and share on social media a lot and that paid off as well as we had a lot of people sharing stuff and creating a great buzz on social, especially LinkedIn. So if people don't know who you are, then I think you've got to have a couple of good speakers on the bill that are attractive to people that go either, 'Oh, I know who that is, I want to see them!' or 'Oh, they're an expert in a topic that I'm interested in that I want to learn more about that!' So we went out and got two big name speakers in our niche - Josh Bersin and Liz Wisman who are both huge in the HR talent development space.",
